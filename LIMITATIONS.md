# Current limitations

What Regalia KMS does **not** do yet, what has not been measured, and the risks accepted on purpose.
This file says what is true **today** on `main`. An entry is added as soon as a limitation is found,
and is removed only by the PR that closes it, which cites its number. The per-component docs carry
the detail. This is the index.

Status words: **not built** (no code yet), **not measured** (code exists, but nothing has shown it on
the real hardware or in the real setting), **accepted** (a risk taken on purpose, with its reason).

## Overall

- **Nothing has run in a ceremony or on the production hardware.** No key ceremony has been held, and
  no Shamir share set exists yet. The three production hosts (HPE DL360 Gen9 with TPM 2.0) have not run
  this software (#253). Whether their TPMs carry an EK certificate is not known (#190). Every
  three-node scenario so far runs on a software TPM (swtpm) in CI.
- **Hardware qualification is open**: Nitrokey HSM 2 for production; the Pico HSM is supported but
  not qualified ([`CONFIGURATIONS.md`](CONFIGURATIONS.md)).

## Membership, heartbeats and recovery (deploy/baremetal)

- **The authority host is being retired (#386).** Until #386 merges, `authority.py` and its units are
  still in the tree. They are not part of the production design: heartbeats and revocations are signed
  by 2 of {the three nodes, the owner} (#199).
- **Recovery with only one surviving peer: not built.** `recover` and `reanchor` need two peer chains
  today. With one peer left, a node cannot be recovered or re-anchored. The design is decided, with the
  owner co-signing as the second source behind `--one-source` (#387, PR #395). With **both** peers gone,
  recovery is a new root ceremony, by design.
- **Accepted, once #387 lands:** a one-peer recovery cannot see a revocation that was made after the
  signing laptop last synced, if the surviving peer withholds it and the audit collector has no
  receipt for it. The owner is asked before signing ([`deploy/baremetal/MEMBERSHIP-RECOVERY.md`](deploy/baremetal/MEMBERSHIP-RECOVERY.md)).
- **TPM owner authorization: not built** (#242 step C). Every owner-authorized TPM call runs with an
  **empty** owner authorization: the anchor's define, define-time writes and undefine
  (`membership.HighWater`), the heartbeat counter's definition, recount's undefine, and the AK's
  `evictcontrol` (attest.py, enrol.py). The decided production posture sets the owner authorization,
  kept off the host in envelopes for the owner's cards. Until step C passes it in (through one channel,
  never argv), enrolment, reanchor, recount and replacement fail closed on a host whose owner
  authorization is set. Enrolment does not yet refuse a TPM whose owner or lockout authorization is
  empty.
- **Rotating the system-phase PCR key: not built.** The anchor's write policy names one key, and
  PolicyOR(old, new) is deferred (#242 follow-up). Rotating that key today makes every anchor
  Unusable until each node is re-anchored.
- **Refusing a crashed node in the wrong boot phase: no end-to-end test** (#397). It is covered by unit
  tests only.
- **Membership recovery commands are not tooled yet** (#387): the recovery doc names Python functions,
  not commands.

## Tokens and the HSM gate (#72)

- **The physical pull-and-reinsert drill has not been run** (G3). The script is merged
  (`e2e/hsm-gate-drill.py`) and needs a person at the bench. Reader names and slot flags were checked
  on the Nitrokeys and a YubiKey. **The Pico has not been tested** for any part of G3.
- **The production daemon must be the `-tags piv` build.** No image builder ships the daemon yet
  (#61). A daemon built without it refuses to start when admission is required and a removable token
  is configured.

## The owner's and the release cards (ADR D30)

- **Not measured**: the developer-card layout has not been shown on a staging YubiKey. The layout
  is the owner key in OpenPGP SIG, owner-auth in DEC, and SSH commit signing in AUT. The three checks
  still to run are a raw Ed25519 signature from SIG through OpenSC, an OpenPGP certificate built on the
  existing card key with DEC bound to it, and git SSH signing from AUT. If the first fails, the owner key
  moves to PIV.
- **Not measured: touch-required behaviour** on the owner and release keys. It needs the owner at
  the bench.
- **Accepted:** a release card stolen together with its PIN can sign a release. Mitigations: touch is
  fixed, and three wrong PINs lock the card. Recovery is a new release key, published as a rotation.
- **Not decided:** whether the owner must also approve a release when the release specialist is
  someone else (to be settled when the company has staff). Whether a technical director gets
  recovery-only cards is awaiting the owner.

## Ceremony inputs (`manifest propose --genesis`, `enrol`, the card record, build provenance)

- **Not measured**: `propose`/`sign --genesis`, the card-record verifier and build provenance have run
  only with software keys, software TPMs and in CI.
- **Genesis node entries are not signed** (#399). `propose --genesis` cannot tell a node's
  `enrol entry` file from an edited copy. A mismatch is caught by that node's `enrol check`, but only
  after the root has signed, so the cost is redoing the genesis, not a silent acceptance. Until then the
  operator carries the files and reads the printed diff.
- **Card attestation is checked by digest only** (#400). The consuming side checks the digests of the
  cards' attestation certificates. "Attested" rests on the root's signature over the producer's own
  verification. The certificates are kept on the ceremony disc for a manual re-check.
- **The bench-token lists are kept by hand** (`membership.BENCH_NITROKEYS`, `BENCH_PICOS`,
  `BENCH_YUBIKEYS`). A new bench token must be added there. A test keeps the drills' staging list equal
  to it, and nothing ties it to the operators' staging registry.
- **Build provenance** hashes only the files in `REPO_FILES`. It compares the Go release by **name**
  with `go.mod`, not the toolchain binary, which the builder verifies through the Go checksum database.
  `build-initrd.sh` runs git as the checkout's owner with no global or system configuration (#384).
  `uki.py`'s own checkout is being given the same rule.

## Audit and monitoring

- The external audit collector and the monitoring service are **contracts only**
  ([`deploy/baremetal/AUDIT-COLLECTOR.md`](deploy/baremetal/AUDIT-COLLECTOR.md),
  [`deploy/baremetal/MONITORING.md`](deploy/baremetal/MONITORING.md)). The real service has not been
  chosen or deployed. The conformance suite runs against the reference collector in CI.
- **Collector receipts carry no signed time** (#398), so a stale receipt still verifies. This matters
  for the one-peer recovery witness (#387).

## Products on the roadmap

- **No OpenBao plugin** ([`OPENBAO-COMPATIBILITY.md`](OPENBAO-COMPATIBILITY.md)).
- **No release-signing tool for the card-held release key** (planned).
- **No Kubernetes KMS provider** (planned).
